# led-temp-lcd
A temperature sensor with LEDs to indicate the current temperature by color. An LCD to display the exact temperature.
You can use any mikrocontroller that has a 3V3 pin. The DHT22 can only handle 3V3 volts, otherwise it will get damaged!
Each led needs a 220 ohm resistor between the GND pin and the led, otherwise it will geht damaged!

*Parts that you need*
- Mikrocontroller with 3V3 Pin
- I2c LCD Display
- Temperature Sensor (DHT22)
- 3 leds (blue, green and red)
- 3 220 ohm resistors

*Librarys you need to install*
- LiquidCrystal_I2C
- Wire
- DHT22 (or DHT sensor library) 
- Adafruit Unified Sensor
